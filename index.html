      <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
	  
      <p> A final year student at De Montfort University studying BSc (Hons) Information and communication Technology seeking a graduate opportunity in both technology and the IT sector. 
        I have excellent communication skills and have had experience of visiting different client sites,
        assessing their needs and demonstrating what I can offer to improve their business outlook. 
        I have actively taken into account my studies and the roles I have been involved with, 
        to improve my skills and abilities to adapt to the way of life. 
        Being determined and decisive I like to use my initiative to develop effective solutions and overcome problems to challenges. 
        Having worked as a team during projects for University has also helped me enhance my interpersonal skills and enabled me to work efficiently under pressure.
