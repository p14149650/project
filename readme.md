#Student: P14149650
Module: CTEC3905 website


My website is split into 4 sections which include my personal profile, my common interests, skills, and placement journey.


My personal profile will display a rollover image of myself near the navigation tab with a background overlay image.

My common interests section will include bullet point tabs and images of the things that inspire me.

my skills section will also present a list and images to highlight my overall skill sets.


I have considered a placement journey section which will include an API of a map displaying my placement location and university.

Links to my initial sketches will be located in the images folder.


The aim and purpose of this website are to deliver my resume/cv profile to enable individuals on my course and other courses to get an insight into a resume format. The cv will present across consistent skill sets and where I've initially worked.

##Audience: 
-My target audience will be university students who want to get an insight into writing a professional cv.

##Proximity: 
-the website will take into consideration sized images so that when the user views the site on a particular device
it should resize the images accordingly.

##Alignment: 
-The website has taken into consideration a single page website as this allows users to refer to individuals elements and by utilising effects such as smooth control enables users to navigate each page with ease.

##Css Colours: 
-The website aims to give each individual heading and subsections a CSS style with set rules to enable the user
to understand the page they are referring to. I have tried to mix my CSS colours as I feel it would be appropriate for users
to get a different theme for each individual section.

##website goal: 
-Hopefully, the website will communicate through cv ideas to students and gain an insight into the skillsets they require when completing an application.

##website testing

###simple and easy

-the user was able to understand the website and its elements included in different subsections.
The user found that the navigation tab was responsive in the way you could size the page and the menu bar would toggle.

-The users appreciated the fact that an image was included of me and they liked the hover over effect, in the way the
image used a rotating transition to show what the particular element was about.

--The smooth scroll element was also useful to the user as the user clicked on a specific link and it would take them to the specific section.
By including a hover over top link allowed the user to navigate back to the specific page. However, the TOP tab could've been animated to further 
guide the user as a top section on its own wouldn't look appealing.

--The images had a really nice border outline applied to make the website look more appealing
and liked the fact that the images rotated as you hover over them providing ease of use and interaction to the user.
However, the images could've been improved by resizing them appropriately.

##look and feel

-The subsections were really nice in the way you resize the page and it changes to a different colour when set at a certain page size.
The use of the background overlay was really good with the gate effect overlaying with the binary background image making the website more insightful
and appealing.

-The text was also minimised through each section by including bullet points and images to give the user something to interact with and to attain a feeling
of the elements used apart from just huge chunks of text.

##overview
- The slideshow was really simple and a nice red border has been applied to it to make it look appealing when resized in the browser.
An extra few images about my placement would've been useful however due to the clarity of the images this wasn't possible and pixellated the image.

-Javascript could have been considered for my google map API i.e I could've animated/pinpointed an arrow to my placement to make it more appealing.
However, I did manage to resize the map so when viewed on the mobile it was responsive.
