Module: CTEC3905


My website is split into 4 sections which include my personal profile, my common interests, skills, and placement journey.


My personal profile will display a rollover image of myself near the navigation tab with a background overlay image.

My common interests section will include bullet point tabs and images of the things that inspire me.

my skills section will also present a list and images to highlight my overall skill sets.


I have considered a placement journey section which will include an API of a map displaying my placement location and university.

Links to my initial sketches will be located in the images folder.


The aim and purpose of this website are to deliver my resume/cv profile to enable individuals on my course and other courses to get an insight into a resume format. The cv will present across consistent skill sets and where I've initially worked.

Audience: My target audience will be university students who want to get an insight into writing a professional cv.

Proximity: the website will take into consideration sized images so that when the user views the site on a particular device
it should resize the images accordingly.

Alignment: The website has taken into consideration a single page website as this allows users to refer to individuals elements and by utilsing effects such as smooth control enables users to navigate each page with ease.

Css Colours: The website aims to give each individual heading and subsections a CSS style with set rules to enable the user
to understand the page they are referring to. I have tried to mix my CSS colours as I feel it would be appropriate for users
to get a different theme for each individual section.

website goal: Hopefully the website will communicate through cv ideas to students and gain an insight into the skillsets they require when completing an application.
