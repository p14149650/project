## Student: P14149650
Module: CTEC3905 website


- My website is split into 4 sections which include my personal profile, my common interests, skills, and placement journey.

- My personal profile will display a rollover image of myself near the navigation tab with a background overlay image.

- My common interests section will include bullet point tabs and images of the things that inspire me.

- My skills section will also present a list and images to highlight my overall skill sets.

- I have considered a placement journey section which will include an API of a map displaying my university location. 
Also, I have considered using social media icons such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn which allows the end user to access my curriculum vitae through the use of hovering over effects and styling to provide more interaction for the user.

## WireFrame Designs:

- Index page:![Sketch 5] (images/wireframe-sketch/placementjourney.jpg)
- Index page:![Sketch 6] (images/wireframe-sketch/sitemap.jpg)

The aim and purpose of this website are to deliver my resume/cv profile to enable individuals on my course and other courses to get an insight into a resume format. The cv will present across consistent skill sets and where I've initially worked.

## Audience: 
- My target audience will be university students who want to get an insight into writing a professional cv.

## Proximity: 
- The website will take into consideration correctly sized images so that when the user views the site on a particular device
it should resize the images accordingly. The navigation bar is responsive so when the user resizes the web page
it toggles the navbar elements into a closed menu tab which makes the website more accessible on any device similar
to other website out there.

## Alignment: 
- The website has taken into consideration a single page website that allows users to refer to individual elements and
 by utilising effects such as smooth scroll between the pages enables users to navigate to each page with ease.

## Css Colours: 
- The website aims to give each individual heading and subsections a CSS style with set rules to enable the user
to understand the page they are referring to. I have tried to mix my CSS colours as I feel it would be appropriate for users
to get a different theme for each individual section.

## website goal: 
- Hopefully, the website will communicate through cv ideas to students and gain an insight into the skillsets they require when completing an application.

## website testing-Peer

## simple and easy

- the user was able to understand the website and its elements included in different subsections.
The user found that the navigation tab was responsive in the way you could size the page and the menu bar would toggle as per the device.

- The users appreciated the fact that an image was included of me and they liked the hover over effect, in the way the
image used a rotating transition to show what the particular element was about.

- The smooth scroll element was also useful to the user as the user clicked on a specific link and it would take them to the specific section.
By including a hover over top link allowed the user to navigate back to the specific page. However, the TOP tab could've been animated to further 
guide the user as a top section on its own wouldn't look appealing.

- The images had a really nice border outline applied to make the website look more appealing
and liked the fact that the images rotated as you hover over them providing ease of use and interaction to the user.
However, the images could've been improved by resizing them appropriately so that it doesn't cut the page.

## look and feel

- The subsections were really nice in the way you resize the page and it changes to a different colour depending the specific device you want to use.
The use of the background overlay was really good with the gate effect overlaying with the binary background image making the website more insightful
and appealing.

- The text was also minimised through each section by including bullet points and images to give the user something to interact with and to attain a feeling
of the elements used apart from just huge chunks of text.

## overview
- The slideshow was really simple and a nice red border has been applied to it to make it look appealing when resized in the browser.
An extra few images about my placement would've been useful however due to the clarity of the images this wasn't possible as it pixellated the image.

- Javascript could have been creatively used on my website for e.g I utilised a google map API to display my university location with an animated bounce
function. To improve this I could've focused on styling the API in terms of the border and adding a new feel for the pinpoint. However, due to the
timescale, I was unable to style my map as there were complexities involved in naming various elements in the CSS.

- Utilised a loading function in the background so that when the user clicks on my website it'll load in the background as if a page was loaded
with all the content. I felt that this function could've been adapted better because it still displays my image while the content appears. On the one side
I could've been more creative on the javascript side by increasing the time of the animation to show the end user that the page is loading however due to time
this wasn't possible due to various elements correlating in my HTML.

- Ran the website through "am I responsive design": http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https:%2F%2Fp14149650.github.io%2Fproject%2F%23. I entered my
GitHub URL in the responsive link tab to see how my site looks on a computer, laptop, tablet, and mobile view. The site seemed quite responsive on each device,
however, an issue was encountered with the navigation button not appearing on the GitHub master link and the code has been checked through notepad++ and the navigation button
does appear when ran through firefox and chrome. When the code has been committed the navigation does toggle but the initial image of the button doesn't appear despite the code being assessed in the HTML and CSS.
Therefore I have added in normal menu tab which has now professionally been styled in the CSS to enable the user to effectively use the drop-down option in a mobile view.
